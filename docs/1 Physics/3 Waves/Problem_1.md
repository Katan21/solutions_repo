# Waves: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface


## Introduction

### Motivation:
- **Interference** occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns.
- On a water surface, ripples from different points meet, forming **distinctive interference patterns**.
- These patterns help us understand how waves combine, either **reinforcing** (constructive interference) or **canceling out** (destructive interference).
- Studying these patterns provides insights into wave behavior, phase relationships, and real-world applications like acoustics, optics, and oceanography.

## Problem Statement

### Task:
Analyze the interference patterns formed on a water surface due to the superposition of waves emitted from **point sources placed at the vertices of a regular polygon**.

---

## Key Concepts

### Wave Equation:
A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source at $(x_0, y_0)$, is described by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos{(kr - \omega t + \phi)}
$$

Where:
- $\eta(x,y,t)$: Displacement of the water surface at point $(x,y)$ and time $t$.
- $A$: Amplitude of the wave.
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$: Wave number, related to wavelength $\lambda$.
- $\omega = 2\pi f$: Angular frequency, related to frequency $f$.
- $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$: Distance from the source to $(x,y)$.
- $\phi$: Initial phase.

---

## Steps to Follow

1. **Select a Regular Polygon**:
   - Choose a polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, pentagon).
   - The number of sides ($N$) determines the number of wave sources.

2. **Position the Sources**:
   - Place wave sources at the vertices of the polygon.
   - Example: For a square, place sources at $(r, r)$, $(-r, r)$, $(-r, -r)$, and $(r, -r)$.

3. **Wave Equations**:
   - Write the wave equation for each source, considering its position $(x_0, y_0)$.

4. **Superposition of Waves**:
   - Sum the wave displacements from all sources:
     $$
     \eta_{\text{sum}}(x,y,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x,y,t)
     $$

5. **Analyze Interference Patterns**:
   - Identify regions of **constructive interference** (waves amplify) and **destructive interference** (waves cancel).

6. **Visualization**:
   - Use graphical tools to visualize the interference patterns.

## Simulation and Visualization

### Python Implementation:
Below is a Python script to simulate and visualize the interference patterns:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
A = 1.0  # Amplitude
wavelength = 1.0
k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength  # Wave number
omega = 2 * np.pi  # Angular frequency
phi = 0  # Initial phase

# Regular polygon vertices (e.g., square)
N = 4
radius = 2.0
angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False)
sources = np.array([(radius * np.cos(angle), radius * np.sin(angle)) for angle in angles])

# Grid for water surface
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 500)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Function to calculate wave displacement from a single source
def wave_displacement(x, y, x0, y0, t):
    r = np.sqrt((x - x0)**2 + (y - y0)**2)
    return A / np.sqrt(r) * np.cos(k * r - omega * t + phi)

# Time
t = 0

# Superposition of waves from all sources
eta_sum = np.zeros_like(X)
for (x0, y0) in sources:
    eta_sum += wave_displacement(X, Y, x0, y0, t)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.contourf(X, Y, eta_sum, levels=50, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(label='Displacement')
plt.scatter(sources[:, 0], sources[:, 1], color='red', label='Sources')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Interference Patterns on a Water Surface')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Results and Discussion

### Graphical Representation:
- The plot shows the **interference patterns** on the water surface.
- **Bright regions**: Constructive interference (waves amplify).
- **Dark regions**: Destructive interference (waves cancel).

### Key Observations:
1. **Constructive Interference**:
   - Occurs when wave crests from different sources align.
   - Results in **amplified wave displacement**.

2. **Destructive Interference**:
   - Occurs when wave crests from one source align with troughs from another.
   - Results in **reduced or canceled wave displacement**.

## Applications

1. **Satellite Deployment**:
   - Understanding wave interference helps in predicting the behavior of waves in space missions.

2. **Acoustics and Optics**:
   - Interference patterns are crucial in designing sound systems and optical instruments.

3. **Oceanography**:
   - Studying wave interactions aids in predicting ocean wave behavior and coastal erosion.
