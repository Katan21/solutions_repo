Alright, let's address the tasks from the provided image in English:

**1. Derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits.**

* **Setup:**
    * Assume a celestial body (planet, satellite) moving in a circular orbit.
    * The centripetal force required for this motion is provided by the gravitational force.
* **Equations:**
    * Gravitational Force (F_g): F_g = G * (M * m) / r² (G: gravitational constant, M: central body mass, m: orbiting body mass, r: orbital radius)
    * Centripetal Force (F_c): F_c = m * v² / r (v: orbital velocity)
    * Orbital Velocity (v): v = 2πr / T (T: orbital period)
* **Derivation:**
    1.  Set F_g = F_c: G * (M * m) / r² = m * v² / r
    2.  Simplify m: G * M / r² = v² / r
    3.  Substitute v: G * M / r² = (2πr / T)² / r
    4.  Rearrange: G * M / r² = 4π²r² / (T² * r)
    5.  Simplify r: G * M / r² = 4π²r / T²
    6.  Isolate T²: T² = (4π² / (G * M)) * r³
* **Result:** T² ∝ r³ (The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius).

**2. Discuss the implications of this relationship for astronomy, including its role in calculating planetary masses and distances.**

* **Planetary Masses:**
    * If we know the orbital period (T) and radius (r) of a satellite, we can calculate the central body's mass (M).
* **Planetary Distances:**
    * If we know the orbital period (T) and the central star's mass (M), we can calculate the orbital radius (r). This is crucial for determining distances in our solar system and exoplanetary systems.
* **Other Applications:**
    * Determining masses of binary star systems.
    * Understanding galactic rotation curves and mass distributions.
    * Estimating the masses of black holes.

**3. Analyze real-world examples, such as the Moon's orbit around Earth or the orbits of planets in the Solar System.**

* **Moon's Orbit:**
    * The Moon's orbital period is about 27.3 days, and its average radius is about 384,400 km. These values can be used to calculate Earth's mass.
* **Solar System Planets:**
    * Each planet has a unique orbital period and radius, consistent with Kepler's Third Law. For example, Jupiter's orbital period is about 11.86 years, and its radius is about 778.5 million km.
* **Exoplanets:**
    * Tools like the Kepler Space Telescope measure exoplanet orbital periods and radii, allowing us to infer their masses and potential habitability.

**4. Implement a computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify the relationship.**

* **Python Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant
M = 1.989e30     # Sun's mass

# Orbital radii
r_values = np.linspace(1e10, 1e12, 100)

# Calculate orbital periods
T_values = np.sqrt((4 * np.pi**2 / (G * M)) * r_values**3)

# Convert to years
T_years = T_values / (365.25 * 24 * 3600)

# Plot
plt.plot(r_values, T_years)
plt.xlabel('Orbital Radius (m)')
plt.ylabel('Orbital Period (years)')
plt.title('Kepler\'s Third Law Simulation')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Verify T^2 and r^3 relationship
plt.plot(r_values**3, T_values**2)
plt.xlabel('r^3 (m^3)')
plt.ylabel('T^2 (s^2)')
plt.title('T^2 vs r^3')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

* **Explanation:**
    * This code calculates orbital periods for various radii and plots them.
    * It also demonstrates the linear relationship between T² and r³.
