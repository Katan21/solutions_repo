# Problem 1

## Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

### Motivation:

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler’s Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems.

### Task:

1. Derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits.
2. Discuss the implications of this relationship for astronomy, including its role in calculating planetary masses and distances.
3. Analyze real-world examples, such as the Moon’s orbit around Earth or the orbits of planets in the Solar System.
4. Implement a computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify the relationship.

### Deliverables:

1. A Markdown document with Python script or notebook implementing the simulations.
2. A detailed explanation of the subjects.
3. Graphical representations of circular orbits and the relationship between orbital period and radius.
4. A discussion on how this relationship extends to elliptical orbits and other celestial bodies.

### Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law for Circular Orbits

To derive Kepler’s Third Law for circular orbits, we start with Newton’s law of gravitation and the centripetal force required for circular motion.

Newton’s law of gravitation states:

$F = \frac{G M m}{r^2}$

Where:

- $ F $ is the gravitational force,
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,
- $ M $ is the mass of the central body,
- $ m $ is the mass of the orbiting body,
- $ r $ is the orbital radius.

The centripetal force required for circular motion is:
$ F = \frac{m v^2}{r} $

Where:
- $ v $ is the orbital velocity.

Setting the gravitational force equal to the centripetal force:
$ \frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r} $

Simplifying, we get:
$ v^2 = \frac{G M}{r} $

The orbital velocity $ v $ can also be expressed in terms of the orbital period $ T $:
$ v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} $

Substituting this into the previous equation:
$ \left( \frac{2 \pi r}{T} \right)^2 = \frac{G M}{r} $

Simplifying further:
$ \frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{G M}{r} $

Rearranging to solve for $ T^2 $:
$ T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M} $

This is Kepler’s Third Law for circular orbits:
$ T^2 \propto r^3 $

### Implications for Astronomy

Kepler’s Third Law is fundamental in astronomy for several reasons:

1. **Determining Planetary Masses**: By observing the orbital period and radius of a moon or satellite, astronomers can calculate the mass of the planet it orbits.
2. **Calculating Distances**: The law helps in determining the distances between celestial bodies in a system.
3. **Understanding Orbital Mechanics**: It provides insights into the dynamics of planetary systems and the forces governing them.

### Real-World Examples

1. **Moon’s Orbit Around Earth**: The Moon’s orbital period and radius around Earth can be used to verify Kepler’s Third Law.
2. **Planetary Orbits in the Solar System**: The orbits of planets around the Sun follow this law, allowing for predictions and calculations of their movements.

### Computational Model

To simulate circular orbits and verify Kepler’s Third Law, we can implement a Python script. Below is an example:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant, m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
M = 5.972e24     # Mass of Earth, kg

# Function to calculate orbital period
def orbital_period(r):
    return np.sqrt((4 * np.pi**2 * r**3) / (G * M))

# Example orbital radii (in meters)
radii = np.linspace(6.371e6, 4.2164e8, 100)  # From Earth's surface to Moon's orbit

# Calculate orbital periods
periods = orbital_period(radii)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(radii, periods, label='Orbital Period vs Radius')
plt.xlabel('Orbital Radius (m)')
plt.ylabel('Orbital Period (s)')
plt.title('Kepler’s Third Law Verification')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Graphical Representation

The plot generated by the above script will show the relationship between the orbital radius and the orbital period, verifying that $ T^2 \propto r^3 $.

### Extension to Elliptical Orbits

Kepler’s Third Law also applies to elliptical orbits, with the semi-major axis replacing the orbital radius. This generalization allows for the analysis of more complex orbital dynamics observed in celestial bodies.
